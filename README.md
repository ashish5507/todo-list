# Do It!! – A Dynamic Task Manager

A clean, modern, and data-driven Todo application built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. This app focuses on dynamic DOM manipulation, modular JavaScript architecture, and a streamlined user experience.



---

## The Vibe
Most todo apps feel cluttered. **Do It!!** is designed to be intentional. It uses a custom-built Project-Task hierarchy that allows you to organize your life into distinct categories with visual priority cues.

---

## Key Features

* **Project Partitioning:** Organize tasks into specific projects to keep your workspace clean.
* **Intelligent UI:** The interface reacts to your data—no hardcoded names. If a project is deleted, the app gracefully transitions to the next available one.
* **Visual Priority System:** High, Medium, and Low priorities are color-coded with distinct indicators for instant recognition.
* **Modern Date Formatting:** Uses localized date strings for human-readable deadlines (e.g., "Jan 16, 3:44 PM").
* **Responsive Layout:** A CSS Grid-based architecture with a dedicated sidebar for project navigation.

---

## Built With

* **Vanilla JavaScript:** Logic, state management, and DOM rendering.
* **Webpack 5:** Asset bundling, dev-server, and automated deployment.
* **CSS3:** Custom properties and Grid/Flexbox for a responsive "App-like" feel.
* **date-fns:** For robust date handling and formatting.
